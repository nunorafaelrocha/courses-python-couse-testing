## Title Slide

```yaml

`@lower_third`
name: Name Surname
title: Instructor

## This is the title

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 8906079207
code_zoom: 50
```

`@part1`
```r
# Load some dataâ€¨
library(caret))
data(Sonar)

# Set seed
set.seed(42)
```

```r
model <- train(
  Class ~ ., 
  data = Sonar, 
  method = "ranger"
)
``` {{1}}

`@part2`
```r
model <- train(
  Class ~ ., 
  data = Sonar, 
  method = "ranger"
)
```

`@script`

## Insert title here...

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: f708c6e360
code_zoom: 50
```

`@part1`
```
# This should be on the page all the time
```

```
This code should appear
```{{2}}
```
Then this code should appear in the same block
```{{3}}

```{r}
if(F) message("Yer aff yer heid!")
Yer aff yer heid!
```{{1}}

`@script`

## Tip 2: TRUE and FALSE

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: c32129aced
code_zoom: 50
```

`@part1`
Suppose we are working out an F-statistic. It would be natural to have
```{r}
# df is the F-density function
(F = df(1, 9, 67))
# [1] 0.7798
```
But R treats positive numbers as `TRUE`, so {{1}}
```{r}
if(F) message("Yer aff yer heid!")
Yer aff yer heid!
```{{1}}
`F` is now treated as `TRUE`! {{1}}

`@script`
